  abstract = {Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) alters the dynamics of lung inflation during mechanical ventilation. Repet‑itive alveolar collapse and expansion (RACE) predisposes the lung to ventilator‑induced lung injury (VILI). Two broad approaches are currently used to minimize VILI: (1) low tidal volume (LVT) with low‑moderate positive end‑expiratory pressure (PEEP); and (2) open lung approach (OLA). The LVT approach attempts to protect already open lung tis‑sue from overdistension, while simultaneously resting collapsed tissue by excluding it from the cycle of mechanical ventilation. By contrast, the OLA attempts to reinflate potentially recruitable lung, usually over a period of seconds to minutes using higher PEEP used to prevent progressive loss of end‑expiratory lung volume (EELV) and RACE. However, even with these protective strategies, clinical studies have shown that ARDS‑related mortality remains unacceptably high with a scarcity of effective interventions over the last two decades. One of the main limitations these varied interventions demonstrate to benefit is the observed clinical and pathologic heterogeneity in ARDS. We have developed an alternative ventilation strategy known as the Time Controlled Adaptive Ventilation (TCAV) method of applying the Airway Pressure Release Ventilation (APRV) mode, which takes advantage of the heterogene‑ous time‑ and pressure‑dependent collapse and reopening of lung units. The TCAV method is a closed‑loop system where the expiratory duration personalizes VT and EELV. Personalization of TCAV is informed and tuned with changes in respiratory system compliance (CRS) measured by the slope of the expiratory flow curve during passive exhala‑tion. Two potentially beneficial features of TCAV are: (i) the expiratory duration is personalized to a given patient’s lung physiology, which promotes alveolar stabilization by halting the progressive collapse of alveoli, thereby minimiz‑ing the time for the reopened lung to collapse again in the next expiration, and (ii) an extended inspiratory phase at a fixed inflation pressure after alveolar stabilization gradually reopens a small amount of tissue with each breath. Subsequently, densely collapsed regions are slowly ratcheted open over a period of hours, or even days. Thus, TCAV has the potential to minimize VILI, reducing ARDS‑related morbidity and mortality.},

  abstract = {Inappropriate mechanical ventilation in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome can lead to ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) and increase the morbidity and mortality. Reopening collapsed lung units may significantly reduce VILI, but the mechanisms governing lung recruitment are unclear. We thus investigated the dynamics of lung recruitment at the alveolar level. Rats ( n = 6) were anesthetized and mechanically ventilated. The lungs were then lavaged with saline to simulate acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). A left thoracotomy was performed, and an in vivo microscope was placed on the lung surface. The lung was recruited to three recruitment pressures (RP) of 20, 30, or 40 cmH               2               O for 40 s while subpleural alveoli were continuously filmed. Following measurement of microscopic alveolar recruitment, the lungs were excised, and macroscopic gross lung recruitment was digitally filmed. Recruitment was quantified by computer image analysis, and data were interpreted using a mathematical model. The majority of alveolar recruitment (78.3 ± 7.4 and 84.6 ± 5.1\%) occurred in the first 2 s (T2) following application of RP 30 and 40, respectively. Only 51.9 ± 5.4\% of the microscopic field was recruited by T2 with RP 20. There was limited recruitment from T2 to T40 at all RPs. The majority of gross lung recruitment also occurred by T2 with gradual recruitment to T40. The data were accurately predicted by a mathematical model incorporating the effects of both pressure and time. Alveolar recruitment is determined by the magnitude of recruiting pressure and length of time pressure is applied, a concept supported by our mathematical model. Such a temporal dependence of alveolar recruitment needs to be considered when recruitment maneuvers for clinical application are designed.},

  abstract = {In the pursuit of science, competitive ideas and debate are necessary means to attain knowledge and expose our ignorance. To quote Murray Gell-Mann (1969 Nobel Prize laureate in Physics): “Scientific orthodoxy kills truth”. In mechanical ventilation, the goal is to provide the best approach to support patients with respiratory failure until the underlying disease resolves, while minimizing iatrogenic damage. This compromise characterizes the philosophy behind the concept of “lung protective” ventilation. Unfortunately, inadequacies of the current conceptual model–that focuses exclusively on a nominal value of low tidal volume and promotes shrinking of the “baby lung” - is reflected in the high mortality rate of patients with moderate and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. These data call for exploration and investigation of competitive models evaluated thoroughly through a scientific process. Airway Pressure Release Ventilation (APRV) is one of the most studied yet controversial modes of mechanical ventilation that shows promise in experimental and clinical data. Over the last 3~decades APRV has evolved from a rescue strategy to a preemptive lung injury prevention approach with potential to stabilize the lung and restore alveolar homogeneity. However, several obstacles have so far impeded the evaluation of APRV’s clinical efficacy in large, randomized trials. For instance, there is no universally accepted standardized method of setting APRV and thus, it is not established whether its effects on clinical outcomes are due to the ventilator mode per se or the method applied. In addition, one distinctive issue that hinders proper scientific evaluation of APRV is the ubiquitous presence of myths and misconceptions repeatedly presented in the literature. In this review we discuss some of these misleading notions and present data to advance scientific discourse around the uses and misuses of APRV in the current literature.},

  abstract = {A high respiratory rate associated with the use of small tidal volumes, recommended for acute lung injury (ALI), shortens time for gas diffusion in the alveoli. This may decrease CO2 elimination. We hypothesized that a postinspiratory pause could enhance CO2 elimination and reduce PaCO2 by reducing dead space in ALI. In 15 mechanically ventilated patients with ALI and hypercapnia, a 20\% postinspiratory pause (Tp20) was applied during a period of 30 min between two ventilation periods without postinspiratory pause (Tp0). Other parameters were kept unchanged. The single breath test for CO2 was recorded every 5 min to measure tidal CO2 elimination (VtCO2), airway dead space (VDaw), and slope of the alveolar plateau. PaO2, PaCO2, and physiological and alveolar dead space (VDphys, VDalv) were determined at the end of each 30-min period. The postinspiratory pause, 0.7 ± 0.2 s, induced on average {$<$}0.5 cmH2O of intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). During Tp20, VtCO2 increased immediately by 28 ± 10\% (14 ± 5 ml per breath compared with 11 ± 4 for Tp0) and then decreased without reaching the initial value within 30 min. The addition of a postinspiratory pause significantly decreased VDaw by 14\% and VDphys by 11\% with no change in VDalv. During Tp20, the slope of the alveolar plateau initially fell to 65 ± 10\% of baseline value and continued to decrease. Tp20 induced a 10 ± 3\% decrease in PaCO2 at 30 min (from 55 ± 10 to 49 ± 9 mmHg, P {$<$} 0.001) with no significant variation in PaO2. Postinspiratory pause has a significant influence on CO2 elimination when small tidal volumes are used during mechanical ventilation for ALI.},

  abstract = {Purpose Experimental animal models of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have shown that the updated airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) methodologies may significantly improve oxygenation, maximize lung recruitment, and attenuate lung injury, without circulatory depression. This led us to hypothesize that early application of APRV in patients with ARDS would allow pulmonary function to recover faster and would reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation as compared with low tidal volume lung protective ventilation (LTV). Methods A total of 138 patients with ARDS who received mechanical ventilation for {$<$}48~h between May 2015 to October 2016 while in the critical care medicine unit (ICU) of the West China Hospital of Sichuan University were enrolled in the study. Patients were randomly assigned to receive APRV (n~=~71) or LTV (n~=~67). The settings for APRV were: high airway pressure (Phigh) set at the last plateau airway pressure (Pplat), not to exceed 30 cmH2O) and low airway pressure ( Plow) set at 5 cmH2O; the release phase (Tlow) setting adjusted to terminate the peak expiratory flow rate to ≥ 50\%; release frequency of 10–14 cycles/min. The settings for LTV were: target tidal volume of 6~mL/kg of predicted body weight; Pplat not exceeding 30~cmH2O; positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) guided by the PEEP–FiO2 table according to the ARDSnet protocol. The primary outcome was the number of days without mechanical ventilation from enrollment to day 28. The secondary endpoints included oxygenation, Pplat, respiratory system compliance, and patient outcomes. Results Compared with the LTV group, patients in the APRV group had a higher median number of ventilator-free days \{19 [interquartile range (IQR) 8–22] vs. 2 (IQR 0–15); P~{$<~$}0.001\}. This finding was independent of the coexisting differences in chronic disease. The APRV group had a shorter stay in the ICU (P~=~0.003). The ICU mortality rate was 19.7\% in the APRV group versus 34.3\% in the LTV group (P~=~0.053) and was associated with better oxygenation and respiratory system compliance, lower Pplat, and less sedation requirement during the first week following enrollment (P~{$<~$}0.05, repeated-measures analysis of variance). Conclusions Compared with LTV, early application of APRV in patients with ARDS improved oxygenation and respiratory system compliance, decreased Pplat and reduced the duration of both mechanical ventilation and ICU stay.
