  abstract = {Background Respiratory dead-space is often increased in lung disease. This study evaluates the effects of increased alveolar dead-space (Vdalv), pulmonary shunt, and abnormal ventilation perfusion ratio ( V\textperiodcentered/Q\textperiodcentered ) distributions on dead-space and alveolar partial pressure of carbon dioxide ( PACO2) calculated by various methods, assesses a recently published non-invasive method (Koulouris method) for the measurement of Bohr dead-space, and evaluates an equation for calculating physiological dead-space (Vdphys) in the presence of pulmonary shunt. Methods Pulmonary shunt, V\textperiodcentered/Q\textperiodcentered distribution and Vdalv were varied in a tidally breathing cardiorespiratory model. Respiratory data generated by the model were analysed to calculate dead-spaces by the Fowler, Bohr, Bohr\textendash Enghoff and Koulouris methods. PACO2 was calculated by the method of Koulouris. Results When Vdalv is increased, Vdphys can be recovered by the Bohr and Bohr\textendash Enghoff equations, but not by the Koulouris method. Shunt increases the calculated Bohr\textendash Enghoff dead-space, but does not affect Fowler, Bohr or Koulouris dead-spaces, or Vdphys estimated by the shunt-corrected equation if pulmonary artery catheterization is available. Bohr\textendash Enghoff but not Koulouris or Fowler dead-space increases with increasing severity of V\textperiodcentered/Q\textperiodcentered maldistribution. When alveolar PCO2 is increased by any mechanism, PACO2 calculated by Koulouris' method does not agree well with average alveolar Pco2. Conclusions Our studies show that increased pulmonary shunt causes an apparent increase in Vdphys, and that abnormal V\textperiodcentered/Q\textperiodcentered distributions affect the calculated Vdphys and Vdalv, but not Fowler dead-space. Dead-space and PACO2 calculated by the Koulouris method do not represent true Bohr dead-space and PACO2 respectively, but the shunt-corrected equation performs well.},

  abstract = {History has been kind to Christian Bohr (1855\textendash 1911). His name is attached eponymously to three different areas of respiratory physiology. The first is the Bohr dead space, which refers to the portion of the tidal volume that does not undergo gas exchange. The second is the increase in oxygen affinity of hemoglobin caused by the addition of carbon dioxide to the blood. This is known as the Bohr effect and is a very important feature of gas exchange, both in the lung and in peripheral tissues. Both of these contributions by Bohr are familiar to most students. Bohr's third contribution refers to the calculation of the changes in the Po               2               of blood as oxygen is loaded in the pulmonary capillary, the so-called Bohr integration. This contribution is less well known now, partly because of the advent of digital computing, but it was important in its day. The analysis is challenging because the very nonlinear shape of the oxygen dissociation curve means that the Po               2               difference between the alveolar gas and the capillary blood, which is the driving pressure for diffusion, changes in a complicated way. All three papers are in German, and two of them are long and tedious to read. English translations are available, but few people read the papers, despite the fact that the first two articles are very frequently cited. In the present article, Bohr's contributions are reviewed, and some parts of the articles that are particularly difficult to understand are clarified.},
