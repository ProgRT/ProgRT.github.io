  abstract = {Weaning patients from mechanical ventilation (MV) is a complex process that may result in either success or failure. The use of ultrasound at the bedside to assess organs may help to identify the underlying mechanisms that could lead to weaning failure and enable proactive measures to minimize extubation failure. Moreover, ultrasound could be used to accurately identify pulmonary diseases, which may be responsive to respiratory physiotherapy, as well as monitor the effectiveness of physiotherapists' interventions. This article provides a comprehensive review of the role of ultrasonography during the weaning process in critically ill patients.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The evaluation of patient effort is pivotal during pressure support ventilation, but a non-invasive, continuous, quantitative method to assess patient inspiratory effort is still lacking. We hypothesized that the concavity of the inspiratory flow-time waveform could be useful to estimate patient's inspiratory effort. The purpose of this study was to assess whether the shape of the inspiratory flow, as quantified by a numeric indicator, could be associated with inspiratory effort during pressure support ventilation. METHODS: Twenty-four patients in pressure support ventilation were enrolled. A mathematical relationship describing the decay pattern of the inspiratory flow profile was developed. The parameter hypothesized to estimate effort was named Flow Index. Esophageal pressure, airway pressure, airflow, and volume waveforms were recorded at three support levels (maximum, minimum and baseline). The association between Flow Index and reference measures of patient effort (pressure time product and pressure generated by respiratory muscles) was evaluated using linear mixed effects models adjusted for tidal volume, respiratory rate and respiratory rate/tidal volume. RESULTS: Flow Index was different at the three pressure support levels and all group comparisons were statistically significant. In all tested models, Flow Index was independently associated with patient effort (p\,{$<$}\,0.001). Flow Index prediction of inspiratory effort agreed with esophageal pressure-based methods. CONCLUSIONS: Flow Index is associated with patient inspiratory effort during pressure support ventilation, and may provide potentially useful information for setting inspiratory support and monitoring patient-ventilator interactions.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether changes in breathing pattern, neuromuscular drive (P0.1), and the work involved in breathing might help to set the individual appropriate level of pressure support ventilation (PSV) in patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) requiring ventilatory assistance. DESIGN: A prospective, interventional study. SETTING: An 8-bed multidisciplinary intensive care unit (ICU). PATIENTS: Ten patients with ARF due to adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis or airway infection were included in the study. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with acute exacerbation were excluded. None of these patients was in the weaning process. INTERVENTIONS: We found a level of pressure support able to generate a condition of near-relaxation in each patient, as evidenced by work of breathing (WOB) values close to 0 J/1. This level was called PS 100 and baseline physiological measurements, namely, breathing pattern, P0.1 and WOB were obtained. Pressure support was then reduced to 85\%, 70\%, and 50\% of the initial value and the same set of measurements was obtained. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Flow (V) was measured by a flow sensor (Varflex) positioned between the Y-piece of the breathing circuit and the endotracheal tube. Tidal volume was obtained by numerical integration of the flow signal. Airway pressure (P(aw)) was sampled through a catheter attached to the flow sensor. Esophageal pressure (Pes) was measured with a nasogastric tube incorporating an esophageal balloon. The esophageal balloon and flow and pressure sensors were connected to a portable monitor (CP 100 Bicore) that provided real-time display of flow, volume, P(aw) and Pes tracings and loops of Pes/V, P(aw)/V and V/V relationships. The breathing pattern was analyzed from the flow signal. Patient work of breathing (WOB) was calculated by integration of the area of the Pes/V loop. Respiratory drive (P0.1) was measured at the esophageal pressure change during the first 100 ms of a breath, by the quasi-occlusion technique. When pressure support was reduced, we found that the respiration rate significantly increased from PS 100 to PS 85, but varied negligibly with lower pressure support levels. Tidal volume behaved in a similar way, decreasing significantly from PS 100 to PS 85, but hardly changing at PS 70 and PS 50. In contrast, WOB and P0.1 increased progressively with decreasing pressure support levels. The changes in WOB were significant at each stage in the trial, whereas P0.1 increased significantly from PS 100 at other stages. Linear regression analysis revealed a highly positive, significant correlation between WOB and P0.1 at decreasing PSV levels (r = 0.87), whereas the correlation between WOB and ventilatory frequency was less significant (r = 0.53). No other correlation was found. CONCLUSIONS: During pressure support ventilation, P0.1 may be a more sensitive parameter than the assessment of breathing pattern in setting the optimal level of pressure support in individual patients. Although P0.1 was measured with an esophageal balloon in the present study, non-invasive techniques can also be used.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationships between directly measured work of breathing (WOB) and variables of the breathing pattern commonly used at the bedside to infer WOB for intubated, spontaneously breathing patients treated with pressure support ventilation (PSV). DESIGN: In vivo measurements of the WOB were obtained on a consecutive series of adults. Breathing frequency (f), tidal volume (VT), the index of rapid, shallow breathing (f/V T), the duration of respiratory muscle contraction expressed as the ratio of inspiratory time over total respiratory cycle time (TI/TTOT), and a breathing pattern score (applied to approximately 50\% of the patients) which ranks f, VT, sternocleidomastoid muscle activity, substernal retraction, and abdominal paradox on a scale were variables of the breathing pattern were also measured. The greater the breathing pattern score, the lower the WOB and vice versa. SETTING: Surgical ICUs in two university teaching hospitals. PATIENTS: Sixty-seven adults (42 men and 25 women, aged 20 to 78 years) who had acute respiratory failure from various etiologies were studied. All patients were breathing spontaneously receiving continuous positive airway pressure and PSV. INTERVENTIONS: Intraesophageal pressure (indirect measurement of intrapleural pressure) was measured with an esophageal balloon integrated into a nasogastric tube. VT was obtained by positioning a flow sensor between the "Y" piece of breathing circuit and the endotracheal tube. Data from these measurements were directed to a bedside respiratory monitor (Bicore; Allied Healthcare Products; Riverside, Calif) that calculates WOB using the Campbell diagram. Patients received PSV at levels deemed reasonable to unload the respiratory muscles. All measurements were obtained after 15 to 20 min at each level of PSV, averaged over 1 min, and then variables of the breathing pattern were regressed with directly measured values for WOB. RESULTS: All breathing pattern variables poorly predicted WOB as evidenced by the low values for the coefficients of determination (r2). Breathing frequency correlated positively with WOB (r = 0.47, p {$<$} 0.001) and predicted or explained only 22\% (r2 = .22) of the variance in WOB. VT correlated negatively and f/VT and TI/TTOT each correlated positively with WOB. However, these variables predicted only 20 to 27\% of the variance in WOB. The breathing pattern score correlated negatively with WOB and predicted only 43\% of the variance in WOB. A prediction model taking all variables into consideration using multiple regression analysis predicted only 50\% of the variance in WOB; thus, it too was a poor to moderate predictor of WOB. CONCLUSION: Our data reveal that WOB should be measured directly because variables of the breathing pattern commonly used at the bedside appear to be inaccurate and misleading inferences of the WOB. The clinical implication of these findings involves the traditional and empirical practice of titrating PSV based on the breathing pattern. We do not imply that the patient's breathing pattern should be ignored, nor undermine its importance, for it provides useful diagnostic information. It appears, however, that relying primarily on the breathing pattern alone does not provide enough information to accurately assess the respiratory muscle workload. Using the breathing pattern as the primary guideline for selecting a level of PSV may result in inappropriate respiratory muscle workloads. A more comprehensive strategy is to employ WOB measurements and the breathing pattern in a complementary manner when titrating PSV in critically ill patients.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Incorrect adjustment of the respiratory parameters of the mechanical ventilator increases respiratory distress and work of breathing (WOB) in mechanically ventilated patients. The accurate adjustment of pressure support increases thepatient's comfort and decreases respiratory distress and WOB, etc.; thus, the present study was conducted to compare the effects of two pressure support adjustment methods on respiratory distress in patients under mechanical ventilation to investigate whether the rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI)method can reduce patients' respiratory distress more and faster than the tidal volume (VT) and respiratory rate (RR) methods. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was conducted in 2020 on 56 mechanically ventilated patients with respiratory distress. The patients' respiratory distress was first measured using RSBI and the respiratory distress observation scale (RDOS). The pressuresupport was then adjusted in the patients according to the RSBI (in the trial group, n = 33)and VT and RR (in the control group, n = 23). The patients' respiratory distress was measured again in both groups 15 and 30 minutes after the pressure support adjustment. RESULTS: The results showed no significant differences between the two groups in the mean RSBI and RDOS before (p = 0.374, p = 0.657 respectively) and 30 (p = 0.103, p = 0.218 respectively) minutes after the adjustment of the pressure support, but these mean values differed significantly (p = 0.025 for RSBI and p = 0.044 for RDOS) between the groups 15 minutes after the adjustment. Moreover, the interaction effect of the group * time for RDOS has become significant nonlinearly (p = 0.037), but none of the interaction effects of the group * time were significant for RSBI (linear: p = 0.531; nonlinear: p = 0.272). CONCLUSION: These two methods finally reduced the patients' respiratory distress almost equally, but RSBI method can relieve the patients' respiratory distress faster than the VT and RR methods.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Occlusion pressure at 100~ms (P0.1), defined as the negative pressure measured 100~ms after the initiation of an inspiratory effort performed against a closed respiratory circuit, has been shown to be well correlated with central respiratory drive and respiratory effort. Automated P0.1 measurement is available on modern ventilators. However, the reliability of this measurement has never been studied. This bench study aimed at assessing the accuracy of P0.1 measurements automatically performed by different ICU ventilators. METHODS: Five ventilators set in pressure support mode were tested using a two-chamber test lung model simulating spontaneous breathing. P0.1 automatically displayed on the ventilator screen (P0.1vent) was recorded at three levels of simulated inspiratory effort corresponding to P0.1 of 2.5, 5 and 10~cm H2O measured directly at the test lung and considered as the reference values of P0.1 (P0.1ref). The pressure drop after 100~ms was measured offline on the airway pressure-time curves recorded during the automated P0.1 measurements (P0.1aw). P0.1vent was compared to P0.1ref and to P0.1aw. To assess the potential impact of the circuit length, P0.1 were also measured with circuits of different lengths (P0.1circuit). RESULTS: Variations of P0.1vent correlated well with variations of P0.1ref. Overall, P0.1vent underestimated P0.1ref except for the L{\"o}wenstein{\textregistered} ventilator at P0.1ref 2.5 cm H2O and for the Getinge group{\textregistered} ventilator at P0.1ref 10~cm H2O. The agreement between P0.1vent and~P0.1ref assessed with the~Bland-Altman~method~gave~a mean bias of -\,1.3~cm H2O (limits of agreement: 1 and -\,3.7~cm H2O). Analysis of airway pressure-time and flow-time curves showed that all the tested ventilators except the Getinge group{\textregistered} ventilator performed an occlusion of at least 100~ms to measure P0.1. The agreement between~P0.1vent and~P0.1aw assessed with the~Bland-Altman~method~gave~a mean bias of 0.5 cm H2O (limits of agreement: 2.4 and -\,1.4~cm H2O). The circuit's length impacted P0.1 measurements' values. A longer circuit was associated with lower P0.1circuit values. CONCLUSION: P0.1vent relative changes are well correlated to P0.1ref changes in all the tested ventilators. Accuracy of absolute values of P0.1vent varies according to the ventilator model. Overall, P0.1vent underestimates P0.1ref. The length of the circuit may partially explain P0.1vent underestimation.},

  abstract = {Background Excessive respiratory muscle effort during mechanical ventilation may cause patient self-inflicted lung injury and load-induced diaphragm myotrauma, but there are no non-invasive methods to reliably detect elevated transpulmonary driving pressure and elevated respiratory muscle effort during assisted ventilation. We hypothesized that the swing in airway pressure generated by respiratory muscle effort under assisted ventilation when the airway is briefly occluded ({$\Delta$}Pocc) could be used as a highly feasible non-invasive technique to screen for these conditions. Methods Respiratory muscle pressure (Pmus), dynamic transpulmonary driving pressure ({$\Delta$}PL,dyn, the difference between peak and end-expiratory transpulmonary pressure), and {$\Delta$}Pocc were measured daily in mechanically ventilated patients in two ICUs in Toronto, Canada. A conversion factor to predict {$\Delta$}PL,dyn and Pmus from {$\Delta$}Pocc was derived and validated using cross-validation. External validity was assessed in an independent cohort (Nanjing, China). Results Fifty-two daily recordings were collected in 16 patients. In this sample, Pmus and {$\Delta$}PL were frequently excessively high: Pmus exceeded 10\,cm~H2O on 84\% of study days and {$\Delta$}PL,dyn exceeded 15\,cm~H2O on 53\% of study days. {$\Delta$}Pocc measurements accurately detected Pmus {$>$}\,10\,cm~H2O (AUROC 0.92, 95\% CI 0.83--0.97) and {$\Delta$}PL,dyn\,{$>$}\,15\,cm~H2O (AUROC 0.93, 95\% CI 0.86--0.99). In the external validation cohort (n\,=\,12), estimating Pmus and {$\Delta$}PL,dyn from {$\Delta$}Pocc measurements detected excessively high Pmus and {$\Delta$}PL,dyn with similar accuracy (AUROC {$\geq$}\,0.94). Conclusions Measuring {$\Delta$}Pocc enables accurate non-invasive detection of elevated respiratory muscle pressure and transpulmonary driving pressure. Excessive respiratory effort and transpulmonary driving pressure may be frequent in spontaneously breathing ventilated patients.},

  abstract = {Background/Purpose Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation has been regarded as a strategy for improving exercise performance. Whether an increase in the ventilatory support level improves exercise performance in patients who have received invasive ventilation is unknown. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of an additional level of pressure support (PS) ventilation on exercise tolerance in patients undergoing prolonged mechanical ventilation (PMV). Methods This study examined 15 patients who were undergoing PMV. All patients performed an upper-arm exercise test at three PS levels: the baseline PS level (PS), a level 2~cmH2O higher than the baseline level (PS+2), and a level 4~cmH2O higher than the baseline level (PS+4). The physiological response, reasons for discontinuing the exercise test, and exercise duration were recorded and analyzed. Results The tidal volume increased significantly from 271.7~{\textpm}~54.7~mL to 398.3~{\textpm}~88.7~mL at the PS+4 level (p~=~0.01). Significant differences in exercise duration were observed at different PS levels. The exercise duration was significantly longer at the PS+4 level than at the PS and PS+2 levels (146.3~{\textpm}~139.9 seconds vs. 108.5~{\textpm}~85.9 seconds vs. 72.8~{\textpm}~43.9 seconds, p~=~0.038) as their corresponding order. There were significant relationships between resting respiratory rate and exercise duration at the PS (r~=~-0.639, p~=~0.034) and PS+2 levels (r~=~-0.668, p~=~0.025). Conclusion In patients undergoing PMV, an additional PS level of up to 4~cmH2O compared with the baseline setting may help to improve exercise tolerance by prolonging exercise duration.},

  abstract = {Although diaphragmatic dysfunction is an important indicator of severity of illness and poor prognosis in ICU patients, there is no convenient and practical method to monitor diaphragmatic function. This study was designed to analyze diaphragmatic dynamic dysfunction by bedside ultrasound in septic patients and provide quantitative evidence to assess diaphragm function systematically. This prospective observational study was conducted from October 2019 to January 2021 in the Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine. 74 patients suffered from sepsis were recruited and divided into two groups, sepsis group 1 (2\,{$\leq$}\,SOFA\,{$\leq$}\,5, n\,=\,41) and sepsis group 2 (SOFA\,{$>$}\,5, n\,=\,33). 107 healthy volunteers were randomly recruited as the control group. In all participants, the diaphragmatic thickness and excursion were measured directly and the dynamic parameters including thickening fraction (TF), EQB/EDB, Contractile velocity, and area under diaphragmatic movement curve (AUDMC) were calculated by bedside ultrasound during quiet breathing (QB) and deep breathing (DB). Each parameter among three groups was analyzed separately by covariance analysis, which was adjusted~by age, sex, body mass index, MAP, hypertension, and diabetes. First, contractile dysfunction occurred before diaphragmatic atrophy both in sepsis group 1 and sepsis group 2. Second, compared with the control group, the dynamic parameters showed significant decrease in sepsis group 1 and more obvious change in sepsis group 2, including TF, EQB/EDB. Third, the maximum contractile velocity decreased in sepsis group 1, reflecting the damage of intrinsic contraction efficiency accurately. Finally, per breathing AUDMC in two septic groups were lower than those in control group. However, per minute AUDMC was compensated by increasing respiratory rate in sepsis group 1, whereas it failed to be compensated which indicated gradual failure of diaphragm in sepsis group 2. Diaphragmatic ultrasound can be used to quantitatively evaluate the severity of sepsis patients whose contractile dysfunction occurred before diaphragmatic atrophy. As dynamic parameters, TF and EQB/EDB are early indicator associated with diaphragmatic injury. Furthermore, maximum contractile velocity can reflect intrinsic contraction efficiency accurately.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pre-clinical studies suggest that dyssynchronous diaphragm contractions during mechanical ventilation may cause acute diaphragm dysfunction. We aimed to describe the variability in diaphragm contractile loading conditions during mechanical ventilation and to establish whether dyssynchronous diaphragm contractions are associated with the development of impaired diaphragm dysfunction. METHODS: In patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation for pneumonia, septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or acute brain injury, airway flow and pressure and diaphragm electrical activity (Edi) were recorded hourly around the clock for up to 7 days. Dyssynchronous post-inspiratory diaphragm loading was defined based on the duration of neural inspiration after expiratory cycling of the ventilator. Diaphragm function was assessed on a daily basis by neuromuscular coupling (NMC, the ratio of transdiaphragmatic pressure to diaphragm electrical activity). RESULTS: A total of 4508 hourly recordings were collected in 45 patients. Edi was low or absent ({$\leq$}\,5~{\textmu}V) in 51\% of study hours (median 71~h per patient, interquartile range 39-101~h). Dyssynchronous post-inspiratory loading was present in 13\% of study hours (median 7~h per patient, interquartile range 2-22~h). The probability of dyssynchronous post-inspiratory loading was increased with reverse triggering (odds ratio 15, 95\% CI 8-35) and premature cycling (odds ratio 8, 95\% CI 6-10). The duration and magnitude of dyssynchronous post-inspiratory loading were associated with a progressive decline in diaphragm NMC (p\,{$<$}\,0.01 for interaction with time). CONCLUSIONS: Dyssynchronous diaphragm contractions may impair diaphragm function during mechanical ventilation. TRIAL REGISTRATION: MYOTRAUMA, ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03108118.

  abstract = {Pressure generated by patient's inspiratory muscles (Pmus) during assisted mechanical ventilation is of significant relevance. However, Pmus is not commonly measured since an esophageal balloon catheter is required. We have previously shown that Pmus can be estimated by measuring the electrical activity of the diaphragm (EAdi) through the Pmus/EAdi index (PEI). We investigated whether PEI could be reliably measured by a brief end-expiratory occlusion maneuver to propose an automated PEI measurement performed by the ventilator. Pmus, EAdi, airway pressure (Paw), and flow waveforms of 12 critically ill patients undergoing assisted mechanical ventilation were recorded. Repeated end-expiratory occlusion maneuvers were performed. PEI was measured at 100~ms (PEI0.1) and 200~ms (PEI0.2) from the start of the occlusion and compared to the PEI measured at the maximum Paw deflection (PEIoccl, reference). PEI0.1 and PEI0.2 tightly correlated with PEIoccl, (p\,{$<$}\,0.001, R2\,=\,0.843 and 0.847). At a patient-level analysis, the highest percentage error was -64\% and 50\% for PEI0.1 and PEI0.2, respectively, suggesting that PEI0.2 might be a more reliable measurement. After correcting the error bias, the PEI0.2 percentage error was lower than\,{\textpm}\,30\% in all but one subjects (range -\,39 to +\,29\%). It is possible to calculate PEI over a brief airway occlusion of 200~ms at inspiratory onset without the need for a full patient's inspiratory effort. Automated and repeated brief airway occlusions performed by the ventilator can provide a real time measurement of PEI; combining the automatically measured PEI with the EAdi trace could be used to continuously display the Pmus waveform at the bedside without the need of an esophageal balloon catheter.},

The occluded inspiratory airway pressure (Pocc) and the airway occlusion pressure at 100 ms (P0.1) have been used as noninvasive methods to assess lung stress and respiratory muscle effort, but comparative performance of these measures and their correlation to diaphragm effort is unknown. The authors hypothesized that Pocc and P0.1 correlate with diaphragm effort and lung stress and would have strong discriminative performance in identifying extremes of lung stress and diaphragm effort.Change in transdiaphragmatic pressure and transpulmonary pressure was obtained with double-balloon nasogastric catheters in critically ill patients (n = 38). Pocc and P0.1 were measured every 1 to 3 h. Correlations between Pocc and P0.1 with change in transdiaphragmatic pressure and transpulmonary pressure were computed from patients from the first cohort. Accuracy of Pocc and P0.1 to identify patients with extremes of lung stress (change in transpulmonary pressure \&gt; 20 cm H2O) and diaphragm effort (change in transdiaphragmatic pressure \&lt; 3 cm H2O and \&gt;12 cm H2O) in the preceding hour was assessed with area under receiver operating characteristic curves. Cutoffs were validated in patients from the second cohort (n = 13).Pocc and P0.1 correlate with change in transpulmonary pressure (R2 = 0.62 and 0.51, respectively) and change in transdiaphragmatic pressure (R2 = 0.53 and 0.22, respectively). Area under receiver operating characteristic curves to detect high lung stress is 0.90 (0.86 to 0.94) for Pocc and 0.88 (0.84 to 0.92) for P0.1. Area under receiver operating characteristic curves to detect low diaphragm effort is 0.97 (0.87 to 1.00) for Pocc and 0.93 (0.81 to 0.99) for P0.1. Area under receiver operating characteristic curves to detect high diaphragm effort is 0.86 (0.81 to 0.91) for Pocc and 0.73 (0.66 to 0.79) for P0.1. Performance was similar in the external dataset.Pocc and P0.1 correlate with lung stress and diaphragm effort in the preceding hour. Diagnostic performance of Pocc and P0.1 to detect extremes in these parameters is reasonable to excellent. Pocc is more accurate in detecting high diaphragm effort.Recent research suggests that optimization of diaphragmatic effort and avoidance of excessive lung stress may facilitate liberation from mechanical ventilation in critically ill patientsLow diaphragmatic effort has been associated with rapid development of disuse atrophy, and excessive effort may result in muscle injury, increased lung stress, and pendelluft (displaced ventilation from recruited to nonrecruited lung regions)Monitoring transdiaphragmatic and transpulmonary pressures may facilitate accurate assessment of diaphragmatic effort and lung stress, respectively, but requires esophageal and gastric manometry, an overly complex process for routine clinical practiceA secondary analysis of two previous studies evaluated the ability of two transient inspiratory airway occlusion maneuvers (Pocc, the total drop in airway pressure during an occlusion, and P0.1, the drop in the first 100\,ms) obtained from the mechanical ventilator to predict either diaphragm effort or lung stressNeither P0.1 nor Pocc should be used to predict exact values for diaphragm effort or lung distending pressureHowever, both maneuvers can reliably identify patients with low or high extremes in diaphragm effort and lung stress, where Pocc outperforms P0.1 based on the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Pressure support ventilation (PSV) should allow spontaneous breathing with a "normal" neuro-ventilatory drive. Low neuro-ventilatory drive puts the patient at risk of diaphragmatic atrophy while high neuro-ventilatory drive may causes dyspnea and patient self-inflicted lung injury. We continuously assessed for 12~h the electrical activity of the diaphragm (EAdi), a close surrogate of neuro-ventilatory drive, during PSV. Our aim was to document the EAdi trend and the occurrence of periods of "Low" and/or "High" neuro-ventilatory drive during clinical application of PSV. METHOD: In 16 critically ill patients ventilated in the PSV mode for clinical reasons, inspiratory peak EAdi peak (EAdiPEAK), pressure time product of the trans-diaphragmatic pressure per breath and per minute (PTPDI/b and PTPDI/min, respectively), breathing pattern and major asynchronies were continuously monitored for 12~h (from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.). We identified breaths with "Normal" (EAdiPEAK 5-15~{$\mu$}V), "Low" (EAdiPEAK\,{$<$}\,5~{$\mu$}V) and "High" (EAdiPEAK\,{$>$}\,15~{$\mu$}V) neuro-ventilatory drive. RESULTS: Within all the analyzed breaths (177.117), the neuro-ventilatory drive, as expressed by the EAdiPEAK, was "Low" in 50.116 breath (28\%), "Normal" in 88.419 breaths (50\%) and "High" in 38.582 breaths (22\%). The average times spent in "Low", "Normal" and "High" class were 1.37, 3.67 and 0.55~h, respectively (p\,{$<$}\,0.0001), with wide variations among patients. Eleven patients remained in the "Low" neuro-ventilatory drive class for more than 1~h, median 6.1 [3.9-8.5]~h and 6 in the "High" neuro-ventilatory drive class, median 3.4 [2.2-7.8]~h. The asynchrony index was significantly higher in the "Low" neuro-ventilatory class, mainly because of a higher number of missed efforts. CONCLUSIONS: We observed wide variations in EAdi amplitude and unevenly distributed "Low" and "High" neuro ventilatory drive periods during 12~h of PSV in critically ill patients. Further studies are needed to assess the possible clinical implications of our physiological findings.},

  abstract = {The assessment of diaphragm function with diaphragm ultrasound seems to bring important clinical information to describe diaphragm work and weakness. When the diaphragm is weak, extradiaphragmatic muscles may play an important role, but whether ultrasound can also assess their activity and function is unknown. This study aimed to (1) evaluate the feasibility of measuring the thickening of the parasternal intercostal and investigate the responsiveness of this muscle to assisted ventilation; and (2) evaluate whether a combined evaluation of the parasternal and the diaphragm could predict failure of a spontaneous breathing trial.First, an exploratory evaluation of the parasternal in 23 healthy subjects. Second, the responsiveness of parasternal to several pressure support levels were studied in 16 patients. Last, parasternal activity was compared in presence or absence of diaphragm dysfunction (assessed by magnetic stimulation of the phrenic nerves and ultrasound) and in case of success/failure of a spontaneous breathing trial in 54 patients.The parasternal was easily accessible in all patients. The interobserver reproducibility was good (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.77 (95\% CI, 0.53 to 0.89). There was a progressive decrease in parasternal muscle thickening fraction with increasing levels of pressure support (Spearman {$\rho$} = -0.61 [95\% CI, -0.74 to -0.44]; P \&lt; 0.0001) and an inverse correlation between parasternal muscle thickening fraction and the pressure generating capacity of the diaphragm (Spearman {$\rho$} = -0.79 [95\% CI, -0.87 to -0.66]; P \&lt; 0.0001). The parasternal muscle thickening fraction was higher in patients with diaphragm dysfunction: 17\% (10 to 25) versus 5\% (3 to 8), P \&lt; 0.0001. The pressure generating capacity of the diaphragm, the diaphragm thickening fraction and the parasternal thickening fraction similarly predicted failure or the spontaneous breathing trial.Ultrasound assessment of the parasternal intercostal muscle is feasible in the intensive care unit and provides novel information regarding the respiratory capacity load balance.Ultrasound can be used to assess work (i.e., function) and weakness of the diaphragm. This can be helpful in predicting difficulty in weaning patients from mechanical ventilation.Patients who have weakness of the diaphragm may compensate with parasternal muscle activity. However, the feasibility of measuring parasternal intercostal muscle thickening with ultrasound and the ability of these measures to be combined with ultrasound evaluation of the diaphragm in order to predict ability to wean from mechanical ventilation has not been well explored.Parasternal intercostal muscle thickness can be measured with ultrasound with good interobserver reproducibility.Parasternal intercostal muscle thickening was responsive to the level of ventilator assistance and significantly higher (i.e., increased) in mechanically ventilated patients with diaphragm dysfunction.The pressure-generating capacity of the diaphragm, the diaphragm thickening fraction, and the parasternal intercostal muscle thickening fraction were all significantly associated with failure of a spontaneous breathing trial in mechanically ventilated patients.},

  abstract = {We reviewed the ventilatory responses obtained from rebreathing experiments on a population of 22 subjects. Our aim was to derive parameter estimates for an `average subject' so as to model the respiratory chemoreflex control system. The rebreathing technique used was modified to include a prior hyperventilation, so that rebreathing started at a hypocapnic PCO2 and ended at a hypercapnic PCO2. In addition, oxygen was added to the rebreathing bag in a controlled manner to maintain iso-oxia during rebreathing, which allowed determination of the response at several iso-oxic PO2 levels. The breath-by-breath responses were analysed in terms of tidal volume, breathing frequency and ventilation. As PCO2 rose, ventilation was first steady at a basal value, then increased as PCO2 exceeded a breakpoint. We interpreted this first breakpoint as the threshold of the combined central and peripheral chemoreflex responses. Above, ventilation increased linearly with PCO2, with tidal volume usually contributing more than frequency to the increase. When breathing was driven strongly, such as in hypoxia, a second breakpoint PCO2 was often observed. Beyond the second breakpoint, ventilation continued to increase linearly with PCO2 at a different slope, with frequency usually contributing more than tidal volume to the increase. We defined the parameters of the variation of tidal volume, frequency and ventilation with PO2 and PCO2 for an average subject based on a three-segment linear fit of the individual responses. These were incorporated into a model of the respiratory chemoreflex control system based on the general scheme of the `Oxford' model. However, instead of considering ventilatory responses alone, the model also incorporates tidal volume and frequency responses.},

In nine nonobstructed acute lung injury (ALI) patients, we applied four levels of PS (0, 5, 10, 15 cm H2O) to modify the inspiratory effort. End inspiratory occlusions (2 to 3 s) were performed at the end of each experimental period by pushing the inspiratory hold button of the ventilator (Servo 900 C; Siemens, Berlin, Germany). We took the difference between the end-inspiratory occlusion plateau pressure and the airway pressure before the occlusion (PEEP + PS) as an estimate of the inspiratory effort and called it PMI (Pmusc,index). From the esophageal pressure tracing we obtained a reference measurement of the pressure developed by the inspiratory muscles at end inspiration (Pmusc,ei) and of the pressure-time product per breath (PTP/b) and per minute (PTP/min). In each patient, PMI was correlated with Pmusc,ei (p {$<$} 0.01) and PTP/b (p {$<$} 0.01). A PMI threshold of 6 cm H2O detected PTP/min {$<$} 125 cm H2O s/min with a sensitivity of 0.89 and a specificity of 0.89. We conclude that PMI is a good estimate of the pressure developed by the inspiratory muscles in ALI patients and may be used to titrate PS level. The major advantage of PMI is that it can be obtained from the ventilator display without any additional equipment.},

Pressure muscle index (PMI), an airway pressure based measurement, has been used as noninvasive monitoring to assess the patient's inspiratory effort. The authors aimed to evaluate the feasibility of pressure support adjustment according to the PMI target and the diagnostic performance of PMI to predict the contribution of the patient's effort during ventilator support. METHODS: In this prospective physiological study, 22 adult patients undergoing pressure support ventilation were enrolled. After an end-inspiratory airway occlusion, airway pressure reached a plateau, and the magnitude of change in plateau from peak airway pressure was defined as PMI. Pressure support was adjusted to obtain the PMI which was closest to -1, 0, +1, +2, and\,+\,3\,cm H2O. Each pressure support level was maintained for 20\,min. Esophageal pressure was monitored. Pressure-time products of respiratory muscle and ventilator insufflation were measured, and the fraction of pressure generated by the patient was calculated to represent the contribution of the patient's inspiratory effort. RESULTS: A total of 105 datasets were collected at different PMI-targeted pressure support levels. The differences in PMI between the target and the obtained value were all within {\textpm}1\,cm H2O. As targeted PMI increased, pressure support settings decreased significantly from a median (interquartile range) of 11 (10-12) to 5 (4-6) cm H2O (p\,{$<$}\,0.001), which resulted in a significant increase in pressure-time products of respiratory muscle [from 2.9 (2.1-5.0) to 6.8 (5.3-8.1) cm H2O{$\bullet$}s] and the fraction of pressure generated by the patient [from 25\% (19-31\%) to 72\% (62-87\%)] (p\,{$<$}\,0.001). The area under receiver operating characteristic curves for PMI to predict 30 and 70\% contribution of patient's effort were 0.93 and 0.95, respectively. High sensitivity (all 1.00), specificity (0.86 and 0.78), and negative predictive value (all 1.00), but low positive predictive value (0.61 and 0.43) were obtained to predict either high or low contribution of patient's effort. CONCLUSION: Our results preliminarily suggested the feasibility of pressure support adjustment according to the PMI target from the ventilator screen. PMI could reliably predict the high and low contribution of a patient's effort during assisted ventilation.Clinical trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT05970393.},

This interaction may lead to patient-ventilator asynchrony, preventing the ventilator from achieving its goals, and may cause patient harm. Flow, volume, and airway pressure signals are significantly affected by patient-ventilator interaction and may serve as a tool to guide the physician to take the appropriate action to improve the synchrony between patient and ventilator. This review discusses the basic waveforms during assisted mechanical ventilation and how their interpretation may influence the management of ventilated patients. The discussion is limited on waveform eye interpretation of the signals without using any intervention which may interrupt the process of mechanical ventilation.},

  abstract = {Respiratory drive is defined as the intensity of respiratory centers output during the breath and is primarily affected by cortical and chemical feedback mechanisms. During the involuntary act of breathing, chemical feedback, primarily mediated through CO2, is the main determinant of respiratory drive. Respiratory drive travels through neural pathways to respiratory muscles, which execute the breathing process and generate inspiratory flow (inspiratory flow-generation pathway). In a healthy state, inspiratory flow-generation pathway is intact, and thus respiratory drive is satisfied by the rate of volume increase, expressed by mean inspiratory flow, which in turn determines tidal volume. In this review, we will explain the pathophysiology of altered respiratory drive by analyzing the respiratory centers response to arterial partial pressure of CO2 (PaCO2) changes. Both high and low respiratory drive have been associated with several adverse effects in critically ill patients. Hence, it is crucial to understand what alters the respiratory drive. Changes in respiratory drive can be explained by simultaneously considering the (1) ventilatory demands, as dictated by respiratory centers activity to CO2 (brain curve); (2) actual ventilatory response to CO2 (ventilation curve); and (3) metabolic hyperbola. During critical illness, multiple mechanisms affect the brain and ventilation curves, as well as metabolic hyperbola, leading to considerable alterations in respiratory drive. In critically ill patients the inspiratory flow-generation pathway is invariably compromised at various levels. Consequently, mean inspiratory flow and tidal volume do not correspond to respiratory drive, and at a given PaCO2, the actual ventilation is less than ventilatory demands, creating a dissociation between brain and ventilation curves. Since the metabolic hyperbola is one of the two variables that determine PaCO2 (the other being the ventilation curve), its upward or downward movements increase or decrease respiratory drive, respectively. Mechanical ventilation indirectly influences respiratory drive by modifying PaCO2 levels through alterations in various parameters of the ventilation curve and metabolic hyperbola. Understanding the diverse factors that modulate respiratory drive at the bedside could enhance clinical assessment and the management of both the patient and the ventilator.},

  abstract = {Rationale: Diaphragm atrophy and dysfunction have been reported in humans during mechanical ventilation, but the prevalence, causes, and functional impact of changes in diaphragm thickness during routine mechanical ventilation for critically ill patients are unknown. Objectives: To describe the evolution of diaphragm thickness over time during mechanical ventilation, its impact on diaphragm function, and the influence of inspiratory effort on this phenomenon. Methods: In three academic intensive care units, 107 patients were enrolled shortly after initiating ventilation along with 10 nonventilated intensive care unit patients (control subjects). Diaphragm thickness and contractile activity (quantified by the inspiratory thickening fraction) were measured daily by ultrasound. Measurements and Main Results: Over the first week of ventilation, diaphragm thickness decreased by more than 10\% in 47 (44\%), was unchanged in 47 (44\%), and increased by more than 10\% in 13 (12\%). Thickness did not vary over time following extubation or in nonventilated patients. Low diaphragm contractile activity was associated with rapid decreases in diaphragm thickness, whereas high contractile activity was associated with increases in diaphragm thickness (P\,=\,0.002). Contractile activity decreased with increasing ventilator driving pressure (P\,=\,0.01) and controlled ventilator modes (P\,=\,0.02). Maximal thickening fraction (a measure of diaphragm function) was lower in patients with decreased or increased diaphragm thickness (n\,=\,10) compared with patients with unchanged thickness (n\,=\,10; P\,=\,0.05 for comparison). Conclusions: Changes in diaphragm thickness are common during mechanical ventilation and may be associated with diaphragmatic weakness. Titrating ventilatory support to maintain normal levels of inspiratory effort may prevent changes in diaphragm configuration associated with mechanical ventilation.},

  abstract = {Rationale: Diaphragm dysfunction worsens outcomes in mechanically ventilated patients, but the clinical impact of potentially preventable changes in diaphragm structure and function caused by mechanical ventilation is unknown. Objectives: To determine whether diaphragm atrophy developing during mechanical ventilation leads to prolonged ventilation. Methods: Diaphragm thickness was measured daily by ultrasound in adults requiring invasive mechanical ventilation; inspiratory effort was assessed by thickening fraction. The primary outcome was time to liberation from ventilation. Secondary outcomes included complications (reintubation, tracheostomy, prolonged ventilation, or death). Associations were adjusted for age, severity of illness, sepsis, sedation, neuromuscular blockade, and comorbidity. Measurements and Main Results: Of 211 patients enrolled, 191 had two or more diaphragm thickness measurements. Thickness decreased more than 10\% in 78 patients (41\%) by median Day 4 (interquartile range, 3--5). Development of decreased thickness was associated with a lower daily probability of liberation from ventilation (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.69; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.54--0.87; per 10\% decrease), prolonged ICU admission (adjusted duration ratio, 1.71; 95\% CI, 1.29--2.27), and a higher risk of complications (adjusted odds ratio, 3.00; 95\% CI, 1.34--6.72). Development of increased thickness (n\,=\,47; 24\%) also predicted prolonged ventilation (adjusted duration ratio, 1.38; 95\% CI, 1.00--1.90). Decreasing thickness was related to abnormally low inspiratory effort; increasing thickness was related to excessive effort. Patients with thickening fraction between 15\% and 30\% (similar to breathing at rest) during the first 3 days had the shortest duration of ventilation. Conclusions: Diaphragm atrophy developing during mechanical ventilation strongly impacts clinical outcomes. Targeting an inspiratory effort level similar to that of healthy subjects at rest might accelerate liberation from ventilation.},

Injury to the lung is mediated by excessive mechanical stress and strain, whereas the diaphragm develops atrophy as a consequence of low respiratory effort and injury in case of excessive effort. The lung and diaphragm-protective mechanical ventilation approach aims to protect both organs simultaneously whenever possible. This review summarizes practical strategies for achieving lung and diaphragm-protective targets at the bedside, focusing on inspiratory and expiratory ventilator settings, monitoring of inspiratory effort or respiratory drive, management of dyssynchrony, and sedation considerations. A number of potential future adjunctive strategies including extracorporeal CO2 removal, partial neuromuscular blockade, and neuromuscular stimulation are also discussed. While clinical trials to confirm the benefit of these approaches are awaited, clinicians should become familiar with assessing and managing patients' respiratory effort, based on existing physiological principles. To protect the lung and the diaphragm, ventilation and sedation might be applied to avoid excessively weak or very strong respiratory efforts and patient-ventilator dysynchrony.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Previous workers have demonstrated that controlled mechanical ventilation results in diaphragm inactivity and elicits a rapid development of diaphragm weakness as a result of both contractile dysfunction and fiber atrophy. Limited data exist regarding the impact of pressure support ventilation, a commonly used mode of mechanical ventilation-that permits partial mechanical activity of the diaphragm-on diaphragm structure and function. We carried out the present study to test the hypothesis that high-level pressure support ventilation decreases the diaphragm pathology associated with CMV. METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to one of the following five groups:1) control (no mechanical ventilation); 2) 12 hrs of controlled mechanical ventilation (12CMV); 3) 18 hrs of controlled mechanical ventilation (18CMV); 4) 12 hrs of pressure support ventilation (12PSV); or 5) 18 hrs of pressure support ventilation (18PSV). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We carried out the following measurements on diaphragm specimens: 4-hydroxynonenal-a marker of oxidative stress, active caspase-3 (casp-3), active calpain-1 (calp-1), fiber type cross-sectional area, and specific force (sp F). Compared with the control, both 12PSV and 18PSV promoted a significant decrement in diaphragmatic specific force production, but to a lesser degree than 12CMV and 18CMV. Furthermore, 12CMV, 18PSV, and 18CMV resulted in significant atrophy in all diaphragm fiber types as well as significant increases in a biomarker of oxidative stress (4-hydroxynonenal) and increased proteolytic activity (20S proteasome, calpain-1, and caspase-3). Furthermore, although no inspiratory effort occurs during controlled mechanical ventilation, it was observed that pressure support ventilation resulted in large decrement, approximately 96\%, in inspiratory effort compared with spontaneously breathing animals. CONCLUSIONS: High levels of prolonged pressure support ventilation promote diaphragmatic atrophy and contractile dysfunction. Furthermore, similar to controlled mechanical ventilation, pressure support ventilation-induced diaphragmatic atrophy and weakness are associated with both diaphragmatic oxidative stress and protease activation.},

A readily available noninvasive surrogate measure of Pmus may help in titrating both mechanical ventilation and sedation to minimize these risks. This bench study explored the feasibility and accuracy of using a ventilator's expiratory pause hold function to measure Pmus across multiple operators. METHODS: A standardized technique for executing a brief ({$<$}1 s) expiratory pause maneuver was used to measure the airway occlusion pressure change ({$\Delta$} Paw) by using 3 simulated Pmus ({$\Delta$} Pmus: 5, 10, 15 cm H2O) under (1) pressure support ventilation (0, 10, 15 cm H2O), (2) volume and pressure-regulated volume ventilation, (3) flow and pressure-triggering, and (4) varying levels of PEEP and pressure-rise time. Individual and grouped measurements were made by 4--7 clinicians on 3 different ventilators. The concordance between occlusion {$\Delta$} Paw and {$\Delta$} Pmus was arbitrarily set at {$\leq$} 2 cm H2O. Data were evaluated by using analysis of variance and the Tukey-Kramer posttest. Correlation was assessed by using the Pearson R test; bias and precision were assessed by using the Bland-Altman method. Alpha was set at 0.05. RESULTS: Grouped expiratory pause maneuver measurements of occlusion {$\Delta$} Paw across simulated {$\Delta$} Pmus, mode and level of ventilatory support showed reasonable concordance, regardless of the ventilator used. Occlusion {$\Delta$} Paw accuracy frequently decreased by {$\sim$}3 cm H2O when both pressure support ventilation and {$\Delta$} Pmus reached 15 cm H2O. Expiratory pause maneuver accuracy was not affected by trigger mechanism and/or sensitivity, PEEP, or the post-trigger pressurization rate. In general, only small differences in {$\Delta$} Paw occurred among the individual operators. CONCLUSIONS: The expiratory pause maneuver generally provided reproducible, stable approximations of {$\Delta$} Pmus across ventilators and ventilator settings, and a range of simulated effort. Technique standardization produced relatively consistent results across multiple operators. The expiratory pause maneuver seemed feasible for general use in monitoring inspiratory effort during assisted mechanical ventilation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most ventilators measure airway occlusion pressure (occlusion P0.1) by occluding the breathing circuit; however, some ventilators can predict P0.1 for each breath without occlusion. Nevertheless, few studies have verified the accuracy of continuous P0.1 measurement. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of continuous P0.1 measurement compared with that of occlusion methods for various ventilators using a lung simulator. METHODS: A total of 42 breathing patterns were validated using a lung simulator in combination with 7 different inspiratory muscular pressures and 3 different rise rates to simulate normal and obstructed lungs. PB980 and Dr{\"a}ger V500 ventilators were used to obtain occlusion P0.1 measurements. The occlusion maneuver was performed on the ventilator, and a corresponding reference P0.1 was recorded from the ASL5000 breathing simulator simultaneously. Hamilton-C6, Hamilton-G5, and Servo-U ventilators were used to obtain sustained P0.1 measurements (continuous P0.1). The reference P0.1 measured with the simulator was analyzed by using a Bland-Altman plot. RESULTS: The 2 lung mechanical models capable of measuring occlusion P0.1 yielded values equivalent to reference P0.1 (bias and precision values were 0.51 and 1.06, respectively, for the Dr{\"a}ger V500, and were 0.54 and 0.91, respectively, for the PB980). Continuous P0.1 for the Hamilton-C6 was underestimated in both the normal and obstructive models (bias and precision values were -2.13 and 1.91, respectively), whereas continuous P0.1 for the Servo-U was underestimated only in the obstructive model (bias and precision values were -0.86 and 1.76, respectively). Continuous P0.1 for the Hamilton-G5 was mostly similar to but less accurate than occlusion P0.1 (bias and precision values were 1.62 and 2.06, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The accuracy of continuous P0.1 measurements varies based on the characteristics of the ventilator and should be interpreted by considering the characteristics of each system. Moreover, measurements obtained with an occluded circuit could be desirable for determining the true P0.1.},

Accordingly, we measured twitch transdiaphragmatic pressure using phrenic nerve stimulation in 11 weaning failure and 8 weaning success patients. Measurements were made before and 30 minutes after spontaneous breathing trials that lasted up to 60 minutes. Twitch transdiaphragmatic pressure was 8.9 {\textpm} 2.2 cm H2O before the trials and 9.4 {\textpm} 2.4 cm H2O after their completion in the weaning failure patients (p = 0.17); the corresponding values in the weaning success patients were 10.3 {\textpm} 1.5 and 11.2 {\textpm} 1.8 cm H2O (p = 0.18). Despite greater load (p = 0.04) and diaphragmatic effort (p = 0.01), the weaning failure patients did not develop low-frequency fatigue probably because of greater recruitment of rib cage and expiratory muscles (p = 0.004) and because clinical signs of distress mandating the reinstitution of mechanical ventilation arose before the development of fatigue. Twitch pressure revealed considerable diaphragmatic weakness in many weaning failure patients. In conclusion, in contrast to our hypothesis, weaning failure was not accompanied by low-frequency fatigue of the diaphragm, although many weaning failure patients displayed diaphragmatic weakness.},

The data were consistent with atrophy of the diaphragm after periods of inactivity on the order of a day. Mechanical ventilation is a critical component of modern intensive care medicine, but the process of discontinuing mechanical ventilation can be difficult.1,2 Laboratory studies have shown that the combination of diaphragmatic inactivity and mechanical ventilation for prolonged periods (more than 18 hours) is associated with atrophy of myofibers in the rat diaphragm.3--5 We hypothesized that similar changes occur in the human diaphragm and that disuse atrophy of human diaphragm myofibers could be a major contributor to the weaning problems that occur in some of our patients.

  abstract = {Background Bedside assessment of low levels of inspiratory effort, which are probably insufficient to prevent muscle atrophy, is challenging. The flow index, which is derived from the analysis of the inspiratory portion of the flow--time waveform, has been recently introduced as a non-invasive parameter to evaluate the inspiratory effort. The primary objective of the present study was to provide an external validation of the flow index to detect low inspiratory effort. Methods Datasets containing flow, airway pressure, and esophageal pressure (Pes)--time waveforms were obtained from a previously published study in 100 acute brain-injured patients undergoing pressure support ventilation. Waveforms data were analyzed offline. A low inspiratory effort was defined by one of the following criteria, work of breathing (WOB) less than 0.3~J/L, Pes--time product (PTPes) per minute less than 50~cmH2O{$\bullet$}s/min, or inspiratory muscle pressure (Pmus) less than 5~cmH2O, adding ``or occurrence of ineffective effort more than 10\%'' for all criteria. The flow index was calculated according to previously reported method. The association of flow index with Pes-derived parameters of effort was investigated. The diagnostic accuracy of the flow index to detect low effort was analyzed. Results Moderate correlations were found between flow index and WOB, Pmus, and PTPes per breath and per minute (Pearson's correlation coefficients ranged from 0.546 to 0.634, P\,{$<$}\,0.001). The incidence of low inspiratory effort was 62\%, 51\%, and 55\% using the definition of WOB, PTPes per minute, and Pmus, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for flow index to diagnose low effort was 0.88, 0.81, and 0.88, for the three respective definition. By using the cutoff value of flow index less than 2.1, the diagnostic performance for the three definitions showed sensitivity of 0.95--0.96, specificity of 0.57--0.71, positive predictive value of 0.70--0.84, and negative predictive value of 0.90--0.93. Conclusions The flow index is associated with Pes-based inspiratory effort measurements. Flow index can be used as a valid instrument to screen low inspiratory effort with a high probability to exclude cases without the condition.},

  abstract = {Pressure support ventilation (PSV) should be titrated considering the pressure developed by the respiratory muscles (Pmusc) to prevent under- and over-assistance. The esophageal pressure (Pes) is the clinical gold standard for Pmusc assessment, but its use is limited by alleged invasiveness and complexity. The least square fitting method and the end-inspiratory occlusion method have been proposed as non-invasive alternatives for Pmusc assessment. The aims of this study were: (1) to compare the accuracy of Pmusc estimation using the end-inspiration occlusion (Pmusc,index) and the least square fitting (Pmusc,lsf) against the reference method based on Pes; (2) to test the accuracy of Pmusc,lsf and of Pmusc,index to detect overassistance, defined as Pmusc\,{$\leq$}\,1 cmH2O. We studied 18 patients at three different PSV levels. At each PSV level, Pmusc, Pmusc,lsf, Pmusc,index were calculated on the same breaths. Differences among Pmusc, Pmusc,lsf, Pmusc,index were analyzed with linear mixed effects models. Bias and agreement were assessed by Bland--Altman analysis for repeated measures. The ability of Pmusc,lsf and Pmusc,index to detect overassistance was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve. Positive and negative predictive values were calculated using cutoff values that maximized the sum of sensitivity and specificity. At each PSV level, Pmusc,lsf was not different from Pmusc (p\,=\,0.96), whereas Pmusc,index was significantly lower than Pmusc. The bias between Pmusc and Pmusc,lsf was zero, whereas Pmusc,index systematically underestimated Pmusc of 6 cmH2O. The limits of agreement between Pmusc and Pmusc,lsf and between Pmusc and Pmusc,index were\,{\textpm}\,12 cmH2O across bias. Both Pmusc,lsf\,{$\leq$}\,4 cmH2O and Pmusc,index\,{$\leq$}\,1 cmH2O had excellent negative predictive value [0.98 (95\% CI 0.94--1) and 0.96 (95\% CI 0.91--0.99), respectively)] to identify over-assistance. The inspiratory effort during PSV could not be accurately estimated by the least square fitting or end-inspiratory occlusion method because the limits of agreement were far above the signal size. These non-invasive approaches, however, could be used to screen patients at risk for absent or minimal respiratory muscles activation to prevent the ventilator-induced diaphragmatic dysfunction.},

Using an easily placed oesophageal balloon catheter and a flow transducer within the ventilator system, intrathoracic pressures, airway pressures and airway flow can be measured, and from these the Bicore calculates 25 other respiratory variables. The monitor screen displays real time waveforms of airway pressure, airway flow, oesophageal pressure and inspired tidal volume, and with these data it should be possible to determine more accurately when patients can be weaned from mechanical ventilation. It should also be possible to assess objectively the onset of respiratory fatigue and failure so that intervention can take place at an earlier stage. To assess the ease of use and potential benefit, the Bicore was used to calculate the work of breathing while weaning eight patients from mechanical ventilation in a spontaneous breathing mode. The pressure support ranged from 20 cmH2O, 10 cmH2O and 5 cmH2O, to a continuous positive airway pressure of 5 cmH2O, all with a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O, down to a single T-circuit with no positive airway pressure or end-expiratory pressure. The work of breathing while on a Veola Hamilton ventilator was found to be about the same, while receiving pressure support of 20 cmH2O compared to a continuous positive airway pressure of 5; the other forms of respiratory support increased the work of breathing significantly.},

Design:~           Prospective clinical study.           Setting:~           Medical-surgical ICU.           Patients:~           Adults under mechanical ventilation for 48 hours or more using pressure support ventilation and without any sedative for 6 hours or more. Overassistance was defined as the occurrence of work of breathing less than 0.3 J/L or 10\% or more of ineffective inspiratory effort. Two alternative overassistance definitions were based on the occurrence of inspiratory esophageal pressure-time product of less than 50 cm H2O s/min or esophageal occlusion pressure of less than 1.5 cm H2O.           Interventions:~           The pressure support was set to 20 cm H2O and decreased in 3-cm H2O steps down to 2 cm H2O.           Measurements and Main Results:~           The following parameters were evaluated to diagnose overassistance: respiratory rate, tidal volume, minute ventilation, peripheral arterial oxygen saturation, rapid shallow breathing index, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, change in esophageal pressure during inspiration, and esophageal and airway occlusion pressure. In all definitions, the respiratory rate had the greatest accuracy for diagnosing overassistance (receiver operating characteristic area = 0.92; 0.91 and 0.76 for work of breathing, pressure-time product and esophageal occlusion pressure in definition, respectively) and always with a cutoff of 17 incursions per minute. In all definitions, a respiratory rate of less than or equal to 12 confirmed overassistance (100\% specificity), whereas a respiratory rate of greater than or equal to 30 excluded overassistance (100\% sensitivity).           Conclusion:~           A respiratory rate of 17 breaths/min is the parameter with the greatest accuracy for diagnosing overassistance. Respiratory rates of less than or equal to 12 or greater than or equal to 30 are useful clinical references to confirm or exclude pressure support overassistance.},

  abstract = {Rationale: Sleep deprivation can alter endurance of skeletal muscles, but its impact on respiratory command is unknown.Objectives: We aimed to assess the effect of sleep deprivation on respiratory motor output and inspiratory endurance.Methods: Inspiratory endurance was investigated twice in random order, following a normal sleep night and a sleepless night. Healthy participants were asked to breathe as long as possible until task failure against a moderate inspiratory threshold constraint. Transdiaphragmatic pressure and diaphragm electrical activity were measured throughout the trial to assess pressure output of the diaphragm and overall respiratory motor output. Cortical contribution to respiratory motor output was assessed by measurement of preinspiratory motor potential amplitude and by cervical magnetic simulation.Measurements and Main Results: Twenty healthy male participants were studied. Time to task failure was significantly shorter after sleep deprivation than after normal sleep: (30 min [interquartile range [IQR], 17-41] vs. 60 min [IQR, 45-60], P\,=\,0.002). At the beginning of the trial, preinspiratory motor potential amplitude was significantly lower in the sleep-deprivation condition (4.5 {$\mu$}V [IQR, 2.5-6.4] vs. 7.3 {$\mu$}V [IQR, 4.3-10.4], P\,=\,0.02) and correlated significantly with the duration of the endurance trial. In the sleep-deprivation condition, preinspiratory motor potential amplitude, electrical activity of the diaphragm, pressure output of the diaphragm, and Vt decreased and the respiratory rate increased significantly from the beginning to the end of the trial. Such decreases did not occur in the normal-sleep condition.Conclusions: One night of sleep deprivation reduces respiratory motor output by altering its cortical component with subsequent reduction of inspiratory endurance by half. These results suggest that altered sleep triggers severe brain dysfunctions that could precipitate respiratory failure.},

  abstract = {Background In pressure-controlled (PC) ventilation, tidal volume (V T) and transpulmonary pressure (P L) result from the addition of ventilator pressure and the patient's inspiratory effort. PC modes can be classified into fully, partially, and non-synchronized modes, and the degree of synchronization may result in different V T and P L despite identical ventilator settings. This study assessed the effects of three PC modes on V T, P L, inspiratory effort (esophageal pressure--time product, PTPes), and airway occlusion pressure, P 0.1. We also assessed whether P 0.1 can be used for evaluating patient effort. Methods Prospective, randomized, crossover physiologic study performed in 14 spontaneously breathing mechanically ventilated patients recovering from acute respiratory failure (1 subsequently withdrew). PC modes were fully (PC-CMV), partially (PC-SIMV), and non-synchronized (PC-IMV using airway pressure release ventilation) and were applied randomly; driving pressure, inspiratory time, and set respiratory rate being similar for all modes. Airway, esophageal pressure, P 0.1, airflow, gas exchange, and hemodynamics were recorded. Results V T was significantly lower during PC-IMV as compared with PC-SIMV and PC-CMV (387~{\textpm}~105 vs 458~{\textpm}~134 vs 482~{\textpm}~108~mL, respectively; p~{$<~$}0.05). Maximal P L was also significantly lower (13.3~{\textpm}~4.9 vs 15.3~{\textpm}~5.7 vs 15.5~{\textpm}~5.2~cmH2O, respectively; p~{$<~$}0.05), but PTPes was significantly higher in PC-IMV (215.6~{\textpm}~154.3 vs 150.0~{\textpm}~102.4 vs 130.9~{\textpm}~101.8~cmH2O~{\texttimes}~s~{\texttimes}~min-1, respectively; p~{$<~$}0.05), with no differences in gas exchange and hemodynamic variables. PTPes increased by more than 15\% in 10 patients and by more than 50\% in 5 patients. An increased P 0.1 could identify high levels of PTPes.

  abstract = {Background High respiratory drive in mechanically ventilated patients with spontaneous breathing effort may cause excessive lung stress and strain and muscle loading. Therefore, it is important to have a reliable estimate of respiratory effort to guarantee lung and diaphragm protective mechanical ventilation. Recently, a novel non-invasive method was found to detect excessive dynamic transpulmonary driving pressure (∆PL) and respiratory muscle pressure (Pmus) with reasonable accuracy. During the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, it was impossible to obtain the gold standard for respiratory effort, esophageal manometry, in every patient. Therefore, we investigated whether this novel non-invasive method could also be applied in COVID-19 patients. Methods ∆PL and Pmus were derived from esophageal manometry in COVID-19 patients. In addition, ∆PL and Pmus were computed from the occlusion pressure (∆Pocc) obtained during an expiratory occlusion maneuver. Measured and computed ∆PL and Pmus were compared and discriminative performance for excessive ∆PL and Pmus was assessed. The relation between occlusion pressure and respiratory effort was also assessed. Results Thirteen patients were included. Patients had a low dynamic lung compliance [24 (20--31) mL/cmH2O], high ∆PL (25\,{\textpm}\,6 cmH2O) and high Pmus (16\,{\textpm}\,7 cmH2O). Low agreement was found between measured and computed ∆PL and Pmus. Excessive ∆PL\,{$>$}\,20 cmH2O and Pmus\,{$>$}\,15 cmH2O were accurately detected (area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) 1.00 [95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.00--1.00], sensitivity 100\% (95\% CI, 72--100\%) and specificity 100\% (95\% CI, 16--100\%) and AUROC 0.98 (95\% CI, 0.90--1.00), sensitivity 100\% (95\% CI, 54--100\%) and specificity 86\% (95\% CI, 42--100\%), respectively). Respiratory effort calculated per minute was highly correlated with ∆Pocc (for esophageal pressure time product per minute (PTPes/min) r2\,=\,0.73; P\,=\,0.0002 and work of breathing (WOB) r2\,=\,0.85; P\,{$<$}\,0.0001).

MV resulted in a decrease (p {$<$} 0.05) in diaphragmatic myofibrillar protein and the cross-sectional area of all muscle fiber types (i.e., I, IIa, IId/x, and IIb).

This review aims to describe available techniques to monitor drive and effort. RECENT FINDINGS: Measuring drive and effort is necessary to quantify risk and implement strategies to minimize lung and the diaphragm injury by modifying sedation and ventilation. Evidence on the efficacy of such strategies is yet to be elucidated, but physiological and epidemiological data support the need to avoid injurious patterns of breathing effort.Some techniques have been used in research for decades (e.g., esophageal pressure or airway occlusion pressure), evidence on their practical utility is growing, and technical advances have eased implementation. More novel techniques (e.g., electrical activity of the diaphragm and ultrasound) are being investigated providing new insights on their use and interpretation. SUMMARY: Available techniques provide reliable measures of the intensity and timing of drive and effort. Simple, noninvasive techniques might be implemented in most patients and the more invasive or time-consuming in more complex patients at higher risk. We encourage clinicians to become familiar with technical details and physiological rationale of each for optimal implementation.},

  abstract = {The measurement of pleural (or intrathoracic) pressure is a key element for a proper setting of mechanical ventilator assistance as both under- and over-assistance may cause detrimental effects on both the lungs and the diaphragm. Esophageal pressure (Pes) is the gold standard tool for such measurements; however, it is invasive and seldom used in daily practice, and easier, bedside-available tools that allow for rapid and continuous monitoring are greatly needed. The tidal swing of central venous pressure (CVP) has long been proposed as a surrogate for pleural pressure (Ppl); however, despite the wide availability of central venous catheters, this variable is very often overlooked in critically ill patients. In the present narrative review, the physiological basis for the use of CVP waveforms to estimate Ppl is presented; the findings of previous and recent papers that addressed this topic are systematically reviewed, and the studies are divided into those reporting positive findings (i.e., CVP was found to be a reliable estimate of Pes or Ppl) and those reporting negative findings. Both the strength and pitfalls of this approach are highlighted, and the current knowledge gaps and direction for future research are delineated.},

  abstract = {Respiratory drive, the intensity of the respiratory center's output, determines the effort exerted in each breath. The increasing awareness of the adverse effects of both strong and weak respiratory efforts during mechanical ventilation on patient outcome brings attention to the respiratory drive of the critically ill patient. Critical illness can affect patients' respiratory drive through multiple pathways, mainly operating through three feedback systems: cortical, metabolic, and chemical. The chemical feedback system, defined as the response of the respiratory center's output to changes in arterial blood gases and pH, is one of the most important determinants of respiratory drive. The purpose of this state-of-the-art review is to describe the determinants of respiratory drive in critically ill patients, review the tools available to assess respiratory drive at the bedside, and discuss the implications of altered respiratory drive during mechanical ventilation. An analysis that relates arterial carbon dioxide levels with brain's response to this stimulus will be presented, contrasting the brain's responses to the patient's ability to generate effective alveolar ventilation, both during unassisted breathing and with different modes of ventilatory assist. This analysis may facilitate comprehension of the pathophysiology of respiratory drive in critically ill patients. As we aim to avoid both over- and under-assistance with mechanical ventilation, considering the patients' respiratory drive at the bedside may improve clinical assessment and management of the patient and the ventilator.},

  abstract = {Background Assessment of the patient's respiratory effort is essential during assisted ventilation. We aimed to evaluate the accuracy of airway pressure (Paw)-based indices to detect potential injurious inspiratory effort during pressure support (PS) ventilation. Methods In this prospective diagnostic accuracy study conducted in four ICUs in two academic hospitals, 28 adult acute respiratory failure patients undergoing PS ventilation were enrolled. A downward PS titration was conducted from 20 cmH2O to 2 cmH2O at a 2 cmH2O interval. By performing an end-expiratory airway occlusion maneuver, the negative Paw generated during the first 100~ms (P0.1) and the maximal negative swing of Paw (∆Pocc) were measured. After an end-inspiratory airway occlusion, Paw reached a plateau, and the magnitude of change in plateau from peak Paw was measured as pressure muscle index (PMI). Esophageal pressure was monitored and inspiratory muscle pressure (Pmus) and Pmus--time product per minute (PTPmus/min) were used as the reference standard for the patient's effort. High and low effort was defined as Pmus\,{$>$}\,10 and\,{$<$}\,5 cmH2O, or PTPmus/min\,{$>$}\,200 and\,{$<$}\,50 cmH2O s min-1, respectively. Results A total of 246 levels of PS were tested. The low inspiratory effort was diagnosed in 145 (59.0\%) and 136 (55.3\%) PS levels using respective Pmus and PTPmus/min criterion. The receiver operating characteristic area of the three Paw-based indices by the respective two criteria ranged from 0.87 to 0.95, and balanced sensitivity (0.83--0.96), specificity (0.74--0.88), and positive (0.80--0.91) and negative predictive values (0.78--0.94) were obtained. The high effort was diagnosed in 34 (13.8\%) and 17 (6.9\%) support levels using Pmus and PTPmus/min criterion, respectively. High receiver operating characteristic areas of the three Paw-based indices by the two criteria were found (0.93--0.95). A high sensitivity (0.80--1.00) and negative predictive value (0.97--1.00) were found with a low positive predictive value (0.23--0.64). Conclusions By performing simple airway occlusion maneuvers, the Paw-based indices could be reliably used to detect low inspiratory efforts. Non-invasive and easily accessible characteristics support their potential bedside use for avoiding over-assistance. More evaluation of their performance is required in cohorts with high effort.
